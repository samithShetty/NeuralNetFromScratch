# **(WORK IN PROGRESS)** A simple Neural Network built from scratch in Python
This is my attempt at building a neural net using just NumPy to improve my understanding of Machine Learning and Neural Network models.

This Neural Network aims to read and classify handwritten digits, 
and was trained/tested on the famous MNIST Digit Dataset, retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data)
