The network will be divided into layers a nodes, such that the first layer of node will represent the inputs (*in this case, the raw pixels values of the image*), and then these values will be passed along manituplated in layers known as the *Hidden layers**, and finally the last layer will represent the outputs. *In our case, there will be 10 possible classifications of an input image* (0-9) *so there will be 10 nodes*. Each node in the network will carry a value, called it's *activation value*, which is calculated from the activation values of the nodes in the previous layer. These previous activation values are scaled and summed to according to tune-able values called ***parameters***:\n",

Then, just so that our line can move off of the origin, we have a bias/offset (`b`). It's also standard to use the variable `z` to represent this total weighted sum, so if we drop in our variable names we'll have: $z = wa + b$\n",
